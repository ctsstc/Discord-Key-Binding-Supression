# Discord-Key-Binding-Supression

Suppresses key presses for push to talk on Discord.

Watches for a bound key, supresses it, and rempas it to an obscure key that Discord can pick up on.

Ultimately this remaps a key, and can be used with any other communication program or for whatever you may need to remap a single key for.

## How to Use

Run the application as an administrator
