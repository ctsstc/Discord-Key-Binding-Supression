# Discord-Key-Binding-Supression

Suppresses key presses for push to talk on Discord.

Watches for a bound key, supresses it, and remaps it to an obscure key that Discord can pick up on.

Ultimately this remaps a key, and can be used with any other communication program or for whatever you may need to remap a single key for.

## How to Use

1. Run the application as an administrator
1. Make sure `On` is displaying in the top left box, if not click it to toggle it.
1. Click **Capture** to change the key you would like to supress.
1. Press the key you would like to capture on the "Key Capture - Press a Key" window that pops up.
1. Choose a key to map to with the Map to Key drop down box. I would reccomend an obscure key like F13-F20.
1. Open Discord and change your settings to to use your new key - push yopur suppressed key and your mapped key should show up.

## Y THO?

If a game has a key that does something in the game, but you never use that key and would like to use it for your push-to-talk key, this works great for that. ie: tild ~ => F14 (A key most keyboards don't have anyways, but exists).
